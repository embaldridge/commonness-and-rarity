Prepare Project Summary (also called Abstract) of Proposed Research and Training. [1 page limit]
 This is an abstract of the proposed research and training. You must
clearly address and identify in separate statements using the three boxes:(1) an overview of the project;(2) the intellectual merit of the proposed activity; and (3) the broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity or the application will be returned without review.
For all areas, list your sponsoring scientist(s) and institution(s) in the overview.

##Research overview

##Intellectual 
##Broader impacts
Current efforts to provide accessibility to chronically ill/disabled scientists are inadequate or non-existent.  I will increase accessibility for scientists by working with Data Carpentry to provide remote access to Data Carpentry workshops, which will allow scientists who need to attend remotely to be able to attend and learn skills that provide a more efficient workflow as well as facilitating remote research and collaboration.  These skills can make possible/easier for a chronically ill researcher to remain an active scientist.

Prepare Project Description (Research and Training Plan).[6 page limit,
including all figures, tables, etc.] 
The research and training plan presents the research that you will conduct and the training that you will receive during the fellowship period and how they relate to your career goals. Include in the research and training plan: 1) a brief and informative introduction or background section; 2) a statement of research objectives, methods, and
significance; 3) training objectives and plan for achieving them (these may include scientific as well as other career preparation activities); 4) an explanation of how the fellowship activities will enhance your career development and future research directions as well as describing how this research differs from your dissertation research; 5) a justification of the choice of sponsoring scientist(s) and host institution(s); 6) a timetable with yearly goals with benchmarks for major anticipated outcomes; 7)a separate section within the narrative, a discussion of the broader impacts of the proposed activities.
