Prepare Project Summary (also called Abstract) of Proposed Research and Training. [1 page limit]
 This is an abstract of the proposed research and training. You must
clearly address and identify in separate statements using the three boxes:(1) an overview of the project;(2) the intellectual merit of the proposed activity; and (3) the broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity or the application will be returned without review.
For all areas, list your sponsoring scientist(s) and institution(s) in the overview.

##Research overview

##Intellectual 

##Broader impacts
Current efforts to provide accessibility to chronically ill/disabled scientists are inadequate or non-existent.  I will increase accessibility for scientists by working with Data Carpentry to provide remote access to Data Carpentry workshops. Remote access will allow scientists who need to attend remotely to be able to attend and learn skills that provide a more efficient workflow as well as facilitating remote research and collaboration.  These skills can make it possible/easier for a chronically ill researcher to remain an active scientist.

Prepare Project Description (Research and Training Plan).[6 page limit,
including all figures, tables, etc.] 
The research and training plan presents the research that you will conduct and the training that you will receive during the fellowship period and how they relate to your career goals. Include in the research and training plan: 1) a brief and informative introduction or background section; 2) a statement of research objectives, methods, and
significance; 3) training objectives and plan for achieving them (these may include scientific as well as other career preparation activities); 4) an explanation of how the fellowship activities will enhance your career development and future research directions as well as describing how this research differs from your dissertation research; 5) a justification of the choice of sponsoring scientist(s) and host institution(s); 6) a timetable with yearly goals with benchmarks for major anticipated outcomes; 7)a separate section within the narrative, a discussion of the broader impacts of the proposed activities.

##Broader impacts
Inadequacy of current efforts to include chronically ill researchers.
A chronically ill researcher is working with less energy, and less physical capacity than an able bodied scientist.  While dealing with a failing body, a scientist should not also have to fight the numerous institutional barriers to remaining an active participant in science.  Having to self-advocate for access robs the researchers of valuable and limited time and energy that he/she could use to be actually doing science.  Many workshops/conferences lack any accessibility information, and the accessibility information that is available is often restricted to the more traditionally visible disability (vision/hearing impairment, mobility restrictions) and buried on the organizational website, rather than being provided in the announcement. Remote access/attendance is          
Tools that a chronically ill researcher can use to remain active in the field.  
Plan for teaching these skills.  
Write accessibility guidelines for workshops/conferences, since clearly no one else is going to do it.

Biographical Sketch[2 page limit]
Submit your CV in the section Biographical Sketches. Follow the form
given in the Grants Program Guide II.C.2.f.i for senior personnel.
List conference abstracts and titles of presentations separate from peer-reviewed articles. For unpublished manuscripts, list only those submitted or accepted for publication (along with most likely date of publication).

Data Management Plan:
All applications must include a supplementary document of no more than two pages labeled "Data Management Plan". Describe plans for data management and sharing of the products of research, or assert the absence of the need for such plans. Upload this to Supplementary Documents–Data Management Plan.
-->
#Data management plan
Research products (code) available on GitHub, version of code used in final analysis will be archived.

Using publicly available data, so data management plan (for data) is not neccessary. 
<!-- 
Mentoring Plan:
A complete sponsoring scientist statement consists of two
parts; a CV of no more than two pages for each sponsor and a single discussion (no more than 3 pages) of the items below. Detailed description of what is required in the Sponsoring Scientist Statement can be found in the solicitation. Upload this to Supplementary Documents–Mentoring Plan.
Note: FastLane will warn youthat the mentoring plan should only be 1 page long. Disregard this warning for the PRFB program.
